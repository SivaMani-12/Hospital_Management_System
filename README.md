# Hospital_Management_System
I developed a hospital management system website using HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Servlet, and JSP. It features both frontend and backend functionalities, with data stored securely in a MySQL database. The project ensures efficient management of hospital-related information through established database connectivity.
